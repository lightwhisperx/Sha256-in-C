# Sha256-in-C
A SHA256 hashing algorithm written in C

Includes basic string hashing but also the SHA256sum of a file and a Bitcoin miner simulation.

It was a university project and is meant to show how the algorithm works.

Part of it was vibe coded but most of it was done with the help of this YT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9EbD6iY9zI&t=109s
and this GitHub repository: https://github.com/in3rsha/sha256-animation
